# Number notation

Numbers in Numbat can be written in the following forms:

* Integer notation
    * `12345`
    * `12_345` — with decimal separators
* Floating point notation
    * `0.234`
    * `.234` — without the leading zero
* Scientific notation
    * `1.234e15`
    * `1.234e+15`
    * `1e-9`
    * `1.0e-9`
* Non-decimal bases notation
    * `0x2A` — Hexadecimal
    * `0o52` — Octal
    * `0b101010` — Binary
* Non-finite numbers
    * `NaN` — Not a number
    * `inf` — Infinity

## Convert numbers to other bases

You can use the `bin`, `oct`, `dec` and `hex` functions to convert numbers to binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal bases,
respectively. You can call those using `hex(2^16 - 1)`, or `2^16 - 1 // hex`, but they are also available as targets of the
conversion operator `->`/`to`, so you can write expressions like:

Examples:
```nbt
0xffee to bin
42 to oct
2^16 - 1 to hex
```

You can also use `base(b)` to convert a number to base `b`:
```nbt
0xffee to base(2)
```
